## Quick Start

The fastest way to get a chart up and running is to use a pre-built theme and layout.  Themes define colors and font sizes in your chart.  Layouts define position, size, and bindings of components inside your chart.

```javascript
var lineChart = new MeteorChart({
  container: 'container',
  width: 500,
  height: 300,
  data: {
    line: [
      {
        title: 'Series 1',
        points: [
          -100, -100,
          100, 100,
          200, 50
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  theme: MeteorChart.Themes.Light,
  layout: MeteorChart.Layouts.StandardLineChart
});
```

## Building the Project

In the root directory, run `npm install`.  Once that finishes, you can run `grunt dev` to build the development version.

## Full Examples

Once you've built the MeteorCharts framework, you can start the node server by going to the root directory and running `node server.js`.  Once the server has started, you can open up your favorite browsers and go to `localhost:1337/examples/index.html` to see a list of all the examples
